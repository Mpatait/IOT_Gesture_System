# IOT_Gesture_System
Final Year Project
🚀 IoT-Based Gesture Recognition System for Media Control
Final Year Engineering Project – Python, Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensors
This project implements a hands-free gesture-controlled media system using Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensors, and a Python GUI (Tkinter).
Using simple hand gestures, users can control volume, play/pause, next/previous, scrolling, and more—without touching the keyboard or mouse.

📌 Project Overview
In an era where intuitive human–computer interaction is essential, this system demonstrates how IoT + gesture recognition can be used to control media interfaces effortlessly.
Two ultrasonic sensors detect hand distance and send data to a Python application via serial communication. The Python script interprets the gestures and triggers media/keyboard events automatically using keyboard and pyautogui.

🎯 Key Features
✔️ Touchless gesture-based media control
✔️ Volume Up/Down using hand proximity
✔️ Play/Pause by placing hands near both sensors
✔️ Next/Previous navigation using hand movement
✔️ Tkinter GUI to show real-time sensor values
✔️ Customizable control profiles (e.g., Media, Gaming, Accessibility)
✔️ Key-binding customization window
✔️ Moving-average filter for stable gesture detection
✔️ Low-cost hardware, highly accurate gesture sensing
